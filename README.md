# pyBattleship
Simple battleship game in python with network play

This game was originally written without network play but I added it quickly as an example of how to adapt an existing project to be network enabled.
Hopefully, it might be useful to someone!

this game uses libtcod (http://roguecentral.org/doryen/libtcod/)
